# family-map-server

Family Map is an application that provides a geographical view of your family history. One of the most exciting aspects of researching family history is discovering your origins. Family Map provides a detailed view of where you came from. It does so by displaying information about important events in your ancestorsâ€™ lives (birth, marriage, death, etc.), and plotting their locations on a Google map.

This app is built using client-server architecture; this is the server. This server was created using Java and a SQL database. I also used JUnit testing framework to implement automated unit tests for Data Access and Service classes.
